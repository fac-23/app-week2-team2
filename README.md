# User stories

- As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there

Since this project is open-ended youâ€™ll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

# Acceptance Criteria

- A form for users to submit data
- A page showing all the data
- Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- A schema describing your database in your README
- Tests for server routes and database access
- Not process user input as SQL commands
- Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

# Stretch criteria

- A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it
- GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push

## Roles:

- Scrum Facilitator and UX Design - _Paolo_
- DevOps - _Juliette_
- Quality Assurance _Orian_

## Project Set up:

- Connect local and remote repos
- Create project set up branch
- Actualize npm directory and install express and cypress
